# Pantograph-Model
Computerized model for pantograph
The pantogrpah is assumed to be lumped mass structure.
The pantograph model is considered as an elastic structure and modelled as a mass-spring-damper system.
The equation of motion of the systems are obtained using Newton’s Second law of motion or Lagrange’s equation.
This system of equation is then solved to obtain the displacement, velocity and acceleration vectors of the system.
